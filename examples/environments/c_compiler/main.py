"""
C Compiler evaluation environment.

Evaluates a submitted Rust project that compiles C source code to the
container architecture (x86_64 in this environment). The submission must
produce a ./cc binary via build.sh.

Usage:  ./cc input.c -o output

Test suites (run in order):
  1. basics
  2. wacct/chapter_1 ... wacct/chapter_20 (or just "wacct" to run all chapters)
  3. c_testsuite/part_* (or just "c_testsuite" to run all parts)
  4. torture/part_* (or just "torture" to run all parts)

Use "all" to run every suite in one call.

Each test suite lives in tests/<name>.py and exposes a run_<name>() coroutine.
See tests/utils.py for the result models and core test runner.

Debug artifact contract (optional, no flags required):
  - The submitted compiler may write debugging output to ./debug_artifacts/.
  - This directory is cleared before each test case.
  - Any files written there are captured and returned in structured failure data.
  - Suggested files include AST/IR/assembly/error traces, but naming is flexible.
