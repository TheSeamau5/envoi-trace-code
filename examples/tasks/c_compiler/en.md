Build a REAL C compiler in Rust from scratch.
This is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: no cheating, no wrappers, no shortcuts.
Do NOT call or wrap cc/gcc/clang/tcc.
Do NOT use saltwater or ANY existing C compiler implementation.
Write all core compiler components yourself in Rust: lexer, parser, codegen, etc.
Target Linux x86_64 (x86-64). Do NOT generate AArch64/ARM64 assembly.

Your submission must include:
- Cargo.toml
- build.sh (must produce ./cc binary when run)
- src/ (your Rust source code)

Interface: ./cc input.c -o output

You have access to a run_tests tool. Use it to test your compiler frequently.

Testing strategy:
1. Run tests frequently after making changes
2. When tests fail: read the error output carefully, fix the code, rerun
3. After fixing, rerun previously passing suites to check for regressions
4. Commit after each meaningful change

Your goal is to pass ALL test suites. Work methodically.
